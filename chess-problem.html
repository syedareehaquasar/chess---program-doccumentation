<h4>The game of Chess aims to give the “mate” in the king of the opponent player. This happens in the following situations:</h4>
<p>The king can not move to any house (they are all in the attack line of the opponent’s pieces);
No part can stand in front and protect the King;
The piece you are attacking cannot be captured;
If any of these conditions arise, then the “mate” or “checkmate” will occur and the game ends, winning the player who applied the “mate".</p>
<h2>Board and Chess Pieces</h2>
<p>The chessboard is composed of squares of white and black color (8 squares of length on each side), being these always alternating.
The pieces also have the same colors and each color corresponds to the pieces of a player.
The board should be positioned so the last house on the right side of the row closest to each player is a white square.
The game of chess consists of the following pieces:
* Pawn
* Tower
* Horse
* Queen
* Bishop
* Rei
The pieces have their own order to be placed on the board (Follow the positions that are represented in the image);
Please note: The position of the King and Queen changes depending on the player, following the rule:
* White King – Black House
* Black King – White House
* White Queen – White House
* Black Queen – Black House</p>
<p>Who starts playing is always the player who owns the white pieces.</p>
<h2>Chess Moves / Plays</h2>
<p>Each piece has its unique way of moving around on the board, which enables a very large number of patterns and strategies, making chess a strategy sport and more interesting.</p>
<p>The possible plays per house piece are:</p>
<h2>Special Moves</h2>
<p>There are certain moves that can be made under special circumstances that make this magnificent game even more interesting and competitive. The special plays that exist are:</p>

<h3>Pedestrian Promotion</h3>
<p>When you can get one of your pawns to reach the end of the board (on the first line of the opponent), the pawn must be replaced by another piece (being a bishop, tower, queen, or horse), and is usually chosen the queen since it is the most powerful piece of the game.</p>
<h3>Roque</h3>
<p>It consists of a movement between the king and the queen, who change positions at the same time, in an attempt to defend the king by taking it from the center of the board and move the tower to a better position of attack.</p>
<p>In this movement, the king moves toward the tower two houses and the tower moves to the king’s side passing over him. There are two rocks: the small and the large, the only difference being its designation. The big rock is when the rock is made with the tower farthest from the king and the small is the opposite.</p>
<p>To make this move, certain conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The king could not have moved;</li>
<li>The tower can not have been moved;</li>
<li>The way between the tower and the king must be clean;</li>
<li>The king can not stand in a position that is in the line of attack of the enemy;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Passing</h3>
<p>This is a special way for the pawn to move and can take the opponent’s pawn that passed next to him when he is in the 5 row counting from his field. Observe the images to better understand the move.</p>
<p>For this move there are also special conditions, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your pawn should be in the 5 row</li>
<li>The pawn of the opponent has advanced two houses and thus have stayed next to his;</li>
<li>The bid must be made immediately to the movement of your opponent;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some Chess Rules</h2>
<p>Chess also has some rules. Let’s just highlight the main rules that are usually addressed.</p>
<p>When a player lifts a piece, it may place it anywhere that is valid for the movement of that piece. After landing the piece cannot be removed, only if it has made an invalid movement.
When promoting a pawn, the player can touch a piece that is outside the board and change for his pawn, thus finishing the move;
During the Roque the player must first take the King and then in the Tower thus making their exchange of positions. If you touch both at the same time you can do it. If this one raises the King with the intention to make the Roque but this is impossible, then it must move the King to a valid house.
Players must not speak during the game, only when asking for a tie or advising the referee of any infraction. In games between amateurs it is common to announce the “check” but among professionals, the same should not be announced.</p>
